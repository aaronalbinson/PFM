          A family business now in its third generation, A. Pollick Ltd was
          established 75 years ago by the managing director's grandfather.


          In the 1970s and 1980s, the firm progressed into working with retail
          chains around the UK. And as the high street has become more complex
          and demanding, we have adapted to meet those new challenges.
