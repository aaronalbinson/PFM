          As a main contractor, we employ and manage sub-contractors both
          appointed and nominated by the client and ourselves.


          The majority of our work is retail-based. This encompasses the high
          street, shopping centres, retail parks, train stations and airports
          all over the UK and Ireland. In addition, we also carry out work in
          offices and showrooms.


          We have worked with some of our clients for a very long time four of
          them for over a decade. A very strong management base means we are
          extremely service-orientated and focussed on keeping our clients
          happy.


          We are able to work from architects' or designers' drawings.
          Alternatively, we can provide a full survey, design, and local
          authority approval service, as required.


          In addition, we run our own manufacturing plant, which enables us to
          design and create anything from full-length bars to small display
          units.

          A family business now in its third generation, A. Pollick Ltd was
          established 75 years ago by the managing director's grandfather.


          In the 1970s and 1980s, the firm progressed into working with retail
          chains around the UK. And as the high street has become more complex
          and demanding, we have adapted to meet those new challenges.
