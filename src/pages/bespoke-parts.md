      **Reverse engineering**


      We specialise in the manufacture of  obsolete and bespoke components from
      samples and drawings.


      **Pin/Needle Segments**


      We also specialise in the manufacture of pinned roller needle  segments to
      suit our [PX5 Hot and Cold Perforating Machines](/perforators).


      We can also replace any pinned rollers for other types of Perforators used
      throughout the world.  Patterns include P1, P1.5, P8, P30 and P160,
      including straight and diamond patterns in Steel and Brass for hot and
      cold perforators. [View our Gallery](/gallery)
