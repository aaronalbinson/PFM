Supporting our local community is very important to us here at Heritage, we've had the pleasure of seeing the Middleton Youth Band progress over the years. We've decided to donate some money to help the youth band secure new instruments and music.

> We would like to say a massive thank you to our friends over at Heritage Engineering North West Ltd, who have donated Â£750 to help support our youth and training bands. Thank you so much for your kindness.
