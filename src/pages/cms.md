      All our websites come with a built in CMS to enable you to modify all the
      content on your website.

      Each website that we build comes with a simple drag and drop content
      management system. This enables you to easily modify the content of the
      website whenever you need to make changes. We've kept this really stripped
      back so that when you login you go directly to the content with a few
      simple clicks. 


      Each element on a page is generated by your content, and can be reordered
      by dragging the content into the correct place.
