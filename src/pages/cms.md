      Each website that we build comes with a simple drag and drop content
      management system. This enables you to easily modify the content of the
      website whenever you need to make changes. We've kept this really stripped
      back so that when you login you go directly to the content with a few
      simple clicks. 


      Each element on a page is generated by your content, and can be reordered
      by dragging the content into the correct place. 


      Once we've built your website you'll receive a how to guide on how to use
      the CMS, this will probably be a one page PDF document, that's how simple
      the content is to edit.


      We'll also be on hand to help out, if you're stuck on something after the
      hand over, feel free to contact us and we'll help you out best we can.
