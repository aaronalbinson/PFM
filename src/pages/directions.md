          ## Directions from Brisbane Airport:


          * Leave the airport, and look for signs for the M1 – Sunshine Coast

          * Follow the M1 northwards, for 70km (appx 45 mins).

          * Turn off at Exit 163 – onto Steve Irwin Way (signposted for
          Australia Zoo)

          * Follow Steve Irwin Way for another 20km/20mins. You’ll pass through
          Glass House Mountains and Beerwah.

          * At Landsborough, turn left off the highway.  Take another left,
          crossing the railway.

          * Turn right onto Cribb St and follow it to the end.

          * Turn right in front of the school, onto Gympie St N.

          * Follow the road as it bends to the left (by the cricket oval).

          * This is Tunnel Ridge Road.  Follow the winding road upwards for
          3.5km.

          * You’ll see signs for a left turn – we are opposite the turn off on
          the right.

          * Turn onto the front parking area – please be careful of oncoming
          traffic!


          ## Directions from the North (Bruce Highway):


          * When you see Aussie World on the right, you’re getting close.

          * Turn off the Bruce at exit 188B (Steve Irwin Way / Landsborough)

          * Follow the exit slip, join the main road, then take a left onto
          Steve Irwin Way.

          * Follow Steve Irwin way for 3km.

          * Turn right at the BP garage (Mooloolah Valley) onto Mooloolah
          Connection Rd.

          * Follow Mooloolah Connection Rd. for 5km.

          * Where the speed limit drops to 60km and the road becomes more
          winding, look for the 2nd road on the left: Tunnel Ridge Road
          (Landsborough).

          * The road goes steeply uphill, then twists and turns. Follow for
          1.5km.

          * After a small road to the left (Ford Rd) the road rises slightly and
          we are on the left hand side (opposite a road off to the right).
