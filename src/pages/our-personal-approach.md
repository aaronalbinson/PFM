      ## Working directly with a developer


      When working with us you'll work directly with a developer. This enables
      us to be a more budget-friendly option, particularly if youâ€™re looking for
      one specific service.

      We're always around to help you out, if it's a quick question or you have
      a new project you'd like to discuss, give us a shout. 


      Once we've done the work for you, we're not gone forever. If you need any
      extra support or you've forgotten how to do something, just drop us a
      note.

      ## Continuous development


      Sometimes the work we've done together might need a little tweak, or maybe
      you've got a new idea for another section on your website. Our flexible
      system means we can add things on and make them work for you for years to
      come. So if it's been a while, and you'd like to make a quick change, let
      us know.
