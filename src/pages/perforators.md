          ## Hot Perforators


          Our Hot Perforators have solid state heater controls with both
          internal and external heated pin rollers. Other features are a timer
          for automatic warm up, automatic speed control which matches the web
          speed to produce round holes, automatic cool down, fully guarded
          interlocks with emergency stop, heat shield for web protection, a
          remote station to stop and start production and pin segments which are
          easily interchangeable for different perforation patterns. The
          diameter of the holes can also be adjusted with the needle depth
          adjusters. The Hot Perforator can easily be installed on to
          slitter/rewind units, bag machines etc.
