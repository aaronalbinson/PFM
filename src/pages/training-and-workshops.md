      ## Training


      We provide training to help you get through your day online.


      **Social media training**


      Let us help you make the most out of your social media by showing you how
      to effectively manage all of your accounts. 


      **Website content management training**


      If we have built your website, we will teach you how to use it as part of
      the work we do when handing the site over to you. However, if someone else
      built your website we can teach you how to manage your content either as
      part of a website audit or a one off training session.


      **Software training**


      If you need any help deciding which software package to use, we can help.
      If that's help resizing images for social media or software to manage your
      content, we have collected our favourite software together and can show
      you how it will help you do the things you need.

      ## Training for Teachers and Children


      **For teachers**


      If you're providing computing and coding lessons to children then it's
      important for you to have confidence in what you're teaching in order for
      the child to feel inspired. We think Computer Science and Coding is going
      to be a big part of children's futures so we want to help you help them.
      You bring the skills to teach, we'll bring the tools and subject
      knowledge.


      **Coding for kids**


      Our one day workshop will get your class making their own games and then
      competing with each other while playing the games that they have made.
      This fun filled day is perfect for getting your class excited about
      coding.
