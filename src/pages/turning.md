          I have been dealing with Mark at Heritage now for the past 4 years for
          various types of work from bespoke one off jobs to regular parts made
          for all sorts of mailing and pre and post paper handling equipment. I
          have always found Heritage easy to work with as they understand the
          pressures of production and go the extra mile to get the jobs done in
          a very timely fashion and right first time, even working late into the
          night so I could get a production line up and running for the next
          days shift.
